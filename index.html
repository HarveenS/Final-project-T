					<h2>Book-8: SHILOH</h2>
					<p>Here’s what I know about Shiloh Jenson:
She is up to no good. 
Every word out of her mouth is a lie. 
And I'm madly in love with her. 
The call of the sea had always been deafening for Mitchell Tate, which is why Kaimte, a small coastal town in West Africa, was the perfect place for him.
Brilliant surf conditions conjured up by the South Atlantic Ocean was the drawcard, and the laid-back lifestyle suited him to a tee. 
But even paradise has a dark side.
						Shiloh has a hidden agenda, and whether he likes it or not, Mitchell is along for the ride.
